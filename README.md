A software engineer, building [syntackle.com](https://syntackle.com)

I break and fix code as a software engineer. Bugs are on my most wanted list. I write a lot (wanna [join me](https://syntackle.com/write/)?). Javascript is one of my favs and it's even better with Typescript. You can find me coding on my projects such as [rssed](https://rssed.netlify.app) and [better](https://github.com/murtuzaalisurti/better), or writing on my blog.

Some of my recent writings:
